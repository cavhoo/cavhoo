### Hendrik (Excyl)
By most standards I am classified as a web developer I guess, althought I don't see myself as one. Since I am mostly
familiar with writing casino games for the web. In recent years I took a detour to learn and ehance my skills with pure
web based development that actually involves HTML and CSS. Prior to that my experience is pure TypeScript/JavaScript and
C++.

## Repos
My repos are mainly just fun stuff I come up with under the shower, and to be quite I honest I suck and staying motivated
to work on something for more then a few weeks. As something always pops up that distracts me, or I simply start something
new that I find more interesting. But from time to time I come back to the projects and a little bit to it and then let it
sit again for weeks or months.

## Languages
My current skillset of languages includes TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, C++ and a bit of Rust which I am learning at the moment.
